Work from Martin Cudicio
Web APP to see all of Denzel Washington's movies

In the home, we offer to see all movies, movies filtered by date and score and a must see movie

for each movie card, if we click on the image, then we can see a description of the movie
There is also the presence of a search button, to display a movie in more detail.
