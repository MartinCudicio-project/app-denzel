Work from Martin Cudicio
Web APP to see all of Denzel Washington's movies

My web app is deployed with netlify

In the home, we offer to see all movies, movies filtered by date and score and a must see movie

for each movie card, if we click on the image, then we can see a description of the movie
There is also the presence of a search button, to display a movie in more detail.
